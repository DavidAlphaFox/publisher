% This is a config for Erlyvideo capture program
% Config is written in erlang syntax, so be careful at "," sign in the end of lists
% 
% audio_capture should be modified only if you want to change microphone. Better if no 
% resampling is done
%
% video_capture can be of two type: uvc and rtsp.
% Here goes example for two of them.
%
% uvc is working with web cameras and requires size, fps and path to libx264 config
% rtsp needs only RTSP url
%
% debug option will show you all written frames

% publish option tells which camera where to publish

% Mention, that first segment of RTMP path is an application name,
% so you can't write  rtmp://192.168.0.1/cam5. You MUST write rtmp://192.168.0.1/live/cam5
% Application name can be any. It really doesn't matter which one it is.
